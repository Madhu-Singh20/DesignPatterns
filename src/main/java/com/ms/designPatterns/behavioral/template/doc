Template Design Pattern
The Template Method Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, while allowing subclasses to override specific steps without changing the overall structure.
It’s part of the GoF (Gang of Four) patterns described in Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.

📌 When to Use It
Use Template Pattern when:
Multiple classes follow the same workflow
Some steps are common
Some steps vary
You want to avoid duplicate code
You want to enforce process order

🧠 Real-World Example
Think of making tea and coffee:
Steps:
Boil water
Brew
Pour into cup
Add condiments
Boiling + pouring are same
Brewing + condiments differ
So you define the process once and allow subclasses to customize parts.

🏗 Structure
AbstractClass
  - templateMethod()  <-- final method (defines algorithm steps)
  - step1()
  - step2()  <-- abstract
  - step3()  <-- abstract

🔥 Key Concepts
Concept	                  Meaning
Template Method	          Defines algorithm structure
Hooks	                  Optional overridable methods
Abstract Methods	      Steps that subclasses must implement
Final Method	          Prevents changing workflow

💡 Template vs Strategy (Interview Question)
Template Pattern	          Strategy Pattern
Uses inheritance	          Uses composition
Algorithm structure fixed	  Algorithm interchangeable
Compile-time behavior	      Runtime behavior

If interviewer asks:
"Why not Strategy instead of Template?"
Answer:
Template enforces workflow order. Strategy allows dynamic switching of algorithm.

🏢 Practical Usage in Enterprise Apps
In Spring Boot:
Abstract batch processing classes
Common controller workflow
Report generation frameworks
Payment processing pipelines
