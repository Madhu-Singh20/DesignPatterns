The Facade Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a
complex system of classes, libraries, or frameworks. It hides internal complexity and exposes only what the
client needs.

Intent-
Provide a unified, easy-to-use interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.

Problem It Solves-
A system has many interdependent classes
Clients must understand too many details
Code becomes tightly coupled and hard to maintain
Facade reduces complexity by acting as a single entry point.

Key Idea-
Instead of calling multiple subsystem classes directly, the client interacts with one facade class, which delegates
work to the appropriate components.

Structure-
Client → Facade → Subsystem Classes
Client: Uses the facade
Facade: Knows which subsystem classes to use
Subsystem Classes: Perform the actual work (unchanged)
